        <h2>Why you should NOT become a music producer</h2>
        <p>
            I know this may sound bad coming from a producer when i say this, but being a music producer is hard work man..
            whenever said producers are not producing a beat, one may suffer as they will always feel the
            never ending urge to make one. Subsequently, when a producer is making a beat, the producer may suffer
            as they may experience a phenomenon also known as beat block. Beat block is much like writers block 
            where a writer may not be able to have any creative ideas to write anything on the page:
            same thing with music producers, they suffer hours of not making anything but wanting to due to our stupid brain.
            Music producers also have to publish and share their music. One downside of this, is when you release your content, only to find out 
            your audience prefers the beat you put less effort into for some reason.. and so you as a producer may try to capitalise on 
            putting less effort into beats, but then that in itself is you putting a moderate amount of effort still! This is because
            of the effort of trying to being minimalistic defeats the purpose of minimalism

            <I><b>If you want to be a producer, make sure you got what it takes for the long mental struggle thats ahead of you!</b></I>

        <h2>Music Producers DONT SLEEP!</h2>
        <p>
            This is a fun fact. music producers dont actually sleep, were just built different and our brain is hard-wired to make music whenever theres nothing more 
            important to do. If you know anything about the human brain, you may know that the brain functions
            on electrical signals... and so as producers we charge our brain via overnight bluetooth connections through the headphones and other
            equipment. we do not need rest, we simply charge and were good to go. Fun fact 2.. producers on average dont sleep after they turn the age of 16.

            Thank you.
